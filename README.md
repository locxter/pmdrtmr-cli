# pmdrtmr-cli

## Overview

This repository includes the CLI frontend of my Pomodoro timer project pmdrtmr, which I build during my work placement at the [KDO](https://www.kdo.de/).

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Debian as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- NodeJS as the development base. Install it with `sudo apt install nodejs npm`.
- VSCodium as universal text editor and IDE. To install it visit their [website](https://vscodium.com/#install).

## How to use it

First install the neede packages via `npm install`. Then run the program via `node .`.
